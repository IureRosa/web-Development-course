					<h1>About me</h1>

					<p>Hello, firstly, welcome and thank you for your interest.<p>

					My name is Iure Rosa Lima de Oliveira, I am a graduate student in the Electrical Engineering course at UFV. On this campus, I had the opportunity to act as a monitor of the discipline of ordinary differential equations, where I improved my teaching and skills with mathematical equations.<br>

					<p>I consider myself a very pragmatic person, always focused on obtaining results through <strike>dedication</strike> and persistence. I seek to understand everything I do, automating whenever possible and delegating when it is most efficient. I am always accepting new challenges.<p>

					<p>I am <em>a lover of learning</em>, always looking to acquire new experiences that add me professionally and personallity. I consider myself to be a very <u>communicative person</u>, I believe I am able to exercise great teamwork.<p>

					<p>I currently conduct research at the Robotics Specialization Center - NERO | UFV, where I develop most of my work. I act as General Director at the Academic Center for Electrical Engineering, as a representative of the student body, and I am a volunteer with the Global Translators Community (GTC), where I translate courses offered by several universities.
